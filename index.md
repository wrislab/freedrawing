Hello. \
[Here is the full list of all the books that are publicly available without copyright.](/copyright-free-books.md)

- If you want go get started as a complete beginner, I'd recommend you to take any one of these 2 books: 
  1. Elements of Drawing by John Ruskin
  2. The Practice and Science of Drawing by Harold Speed

- After that I highly recommend taking Anson Kent Cross's
  1. Hand-free Drawing or John Ruskin's Elements of Perspective.- (here you'll learn Dynamic Sketching),
  2. Light and Shade

- Then read Joseph C. Chase's Drawing Made Easy - It focuses on Perspective, and slightly more on rendering. 
- If you're more inclined toward figure drawing, George B. Bridgman's books are highly recommended.

Happy Drawing!
