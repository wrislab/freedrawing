## 📘 For Complete Beginners

If you want to get started as a complete beginner, I'd recommend you to take any one of these 2 books:

1. **Elements of Drawing** by *John Ruskin*
2. **The Practice and Science of Drawing** by *Harold Speed*

---

## 📈 Next Step: Learn Structure & Technique

After that, I highly recommend taking **Anson Kent Cross's**:

1. *Hand-free Drawing* or *John Ruskin's Elements of Perspective* — (learn Dynamic Sketching)
2. *Light and Shade*

---

## 🖊️ Then Focus on Perspective & Rendering

Read **Joseph C. Chase's _Drawing Made Easy_** — it focuses on perspective and rendering.

---

## 🧍 If You Prefer Figure Drawing

If you're more inclined toward figure drawing, **George B. Bridgman's books** are highly recommended.

Happy Drawing!
