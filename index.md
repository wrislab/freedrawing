# Learn to Draw for Free

Here is the full list of all the books that are publicly available without copyright:

## [Complete Book List](/booklist.md)

Day by day, the internet is getting easier to get lost in—an ocean of content. It’s not uncommon to see people spending more time online looking for the right resource that fits their skill progression than actually learning the skill itself. Struggling to get a grip on a resource to understand where you actually need to improve is real. Because the linear path—a curated syllabus—is often missing. And people are doing business by keeping that syllabus behind a paywall.

Sometimes, paying is good. Adds some extra motivation. But oftentimes, we overlook how much effort artists from earlier centuries put into their craft—effort that made today’s art possible. One way or another, the basic things are being presented over and over again, just in different sets with different names. 

Think for a moment. Look up paintings from past centuries. See how magnificent even some thousand-year-old works are. They also went through the same process of learning. And many brilliant people documented, curated, and passed down their journeys to newer generations.

Obviously, there are some very good books under copyright—no doubt about that. Like the artists of the past, today’s artist-authors have also poured their knowledge and experiences into their books and courses. They deserve to do business with those who can pay. But that doesn’t mean we should use those resources illegally. They won’t bring peace to the soul.

Instead, let’s remember that a whole world of free knowledge still exists—so vast that you may only finish a corner of it in your lifetime. Let’s dive into that.

Have patience. Pick a book. And be amazed as you read these astonishing documentations from past centuries.

Below I have picked some of the good books so that you do not feel overwhelmed to get started. But you can explore any of the other books, and pick whichever suits you. All of the books are legally out on the internet in public domain.

## 📘 For Complete Beginners

If you want to get started as a complete beginner, I'd recommend you to take any one of these 2 books:

1. **Elements of Drawing** by *John Ruskin*
2. **The Practice and Science of Drawing** by *Harold Speed*

---

## 📈 Next Step: Learn Structure & Technique

After that, I highly recommend taking **Anson Kent Cross's**:

1. *Hand-free Drawing* or *John Ruskin's Elements of Perspective* — (learn Dynamic Sketching)
2. *Light and Shade*

---

## 🖊️ Then Focus on Perspective & Rendering

Read **Joseph C. Chase's _Drawing Made Easy_** — it focuses on perspective and rendering.

---

## 🧍 If You Prefer Figure Drawing

If you're more inclined toward figure drawing, **George B. Bridgman's books** are highly recommended.

Happy Drawing!
