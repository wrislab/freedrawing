# Learn to Draw for Free

Here is the full list of all the books that are publicly available without copyright:
[Complete Book List](/copyright-free-books.md). 

Day by day, internet is getting easier to get lost in the ocean of content. It is not uncommon to see people spending more time online looking for the right resource that fits into their skill progression than they actually learn the skill. Struggling to get a grip on a resource to understand where you actually need to improve. Because the linear path, a curated syllabus is often missing. And, people are doing business by keeping the syllabus behind a paywall. But often time, we overlook how much effort artists from earlier century put in arts. One way or another basic things are being presented over time just in different sets with different names. Think for a moment. Look up paintings online, to see how magnificant even a thousand year old paintings are. They also went through the same process of learning the art. And many of the brilliant people have documented, curated, and taught their own journey to the newer generations. Have patience. Pick a book. And be amazed while reading these astonishing documentations from the past centuries.

Below I have picked some of the good books so that you do not feel overwhelmed to get started. But you can explore any of the other books, and pick whichever suits you. All of the books are legally out on the internet in public domain.

## üìò For Complete Beginners

If you want to get started as a complete beginner, I'd recommend you to take any one of these 2 books:

1. **Elements of Drawing** by *John Ruskin*
2. **The Practice and Science of Drawing** by *Harold Speed*

## üìà Next Step: Learn Structure & Technique

After that, I highly recommend taking **Anson Kent Cross's**:

1. *Hand-free Drawing* or *John Ruskin's Elements of Perspective* ‚Äî (learn Dynamic Sketching)
2. *Light and Shade*

## üñäÔ∏è Then Focus on Perspective & Rendering

Read **Joseph C. Chase's _Drawing Made Easy_** ‚Äî it focuses on perspective and rendering.

## üßç If You Prefer Figure Drawing

If you're more inclined toward figure drawing, **George B. Bridgman's books** are highly recommended.
